# PiPyADC
Python module for interfacing Texas Instruments ADS1255 and ADS1256
SPI bus based analog-to-digital converters with the Raspberry Pi.

The ADS1255 and ADS1256 library is an implementation based purely on
Python. Since version 2, this uses the PIGPIO API since wiringpi was
deprecatred by its author before.

On a Raspberry Pi 3, multi-channel ADC reads require a time overhead
of aprox. 300...500 Âµs which makes the library suitable for
low-speed, high resolution data acquisition.
